Snakes have   eternally been a symbolic figure of equally negative and positive   associations in some of the most ancient rituals known to mankind. In   many cultures it symbolizes more about power, health and fertility,   however, for this painting, I wanted to emphasize the beauty of the   snake, with the asymmetry of its shape and its circular motions giving   it a flowing, organic and seductive feel. The purity of the white   background, with the gold leaf inlays on the snake's skin, give the   overall painting both an iconic and modern look.    Max Rodrigues.	f_2138152.jpg

f_1870592	2015-02-23 16:05:22	"Parrot" Sculpture Made by Oggetti of Italy and Designed by Mangani	"Parrot" made by Oggetti and designed by Mangani. This rare bird was produced sometime in the 1970s. The feet are dipped in 24-carat gold. A porcelain “objet d’art” carrying the imprimatur “Mangani” comes with a dedication to excellence. The Mangani family oversees every facet of each porcelain object, from the initial plan of the design to the final decoration. The family involvement with porcelain began in the 1930s. Sr. Mangani worked for one of Florence’s oldest ceramic works during the 1930s. He conceived many porcelain sculptures for the wealthy English and Americans who lived in the sumptuous villas of Florence and its province of Tuscany. After World War II Mangani opened a small workshop for the restoration of marble, ceramic and porcelain. There his young sons Ivan and Lando were exposed to their father’s special skills, watching and working under his supervision. After many years of studying the fine art of porcelain, they took from their father both a knowledge of the technical aspects of the clay and an appreciation for the aesthetic of the material. The Mangani brothers brought this burgeoning expertise to their first small atelier in Florence, which they opened in the early 1960s. With the application of modern techniques, they slowly developed and grew to become one of Florence’s foremost producers of fine porcelains. Ivan passed away in 2002 but left a great legacy to his children who are active participants with their cousins in the Mangani of today. Their production is quite diverse, ranging from reproductions of Baroque period pieces to the highly stylized fish and birds with which their name is synonymous.	f_1870592.jpg

f_1331936	2014-10-27 16:10:31	"Trilogy"  Poly-Resin Suclpture by Louis Von Koelnau # 2/24	Artist's Biography - Louis Von Koelnau.    Louis von Koelnau (pronounced “vahn KELL-now,” as in “now or later”) was born in Chicago in 1924, the only child of artist parents. The senior von Koelnau was a calligrapher and illustrator of children's books, in collaboration with the artist's mother, who was also a medical illustrator for the University of Minnesota.  The family moved to Minneapolis when young Louis was six years old, and settled in the Lakes district of south Minneapolis in a neighborhood of modest but pleasant homes. The future artist reveled in the close observation of nature and marine life there, and also enjoyed many rock and fossil hunting trips with his parents, both of whom were avid amateur mineralogists.    Also, in residence with the family was Louis' maternal grandmother, a woman of iron will and great internal resources. She had departed Riga, Latvia, in 1909 on a ship bound for the United States, her 4 year old daughter (Louis von Koelnau's mother) in arms. She intended to reclaim the recalcitrant husband who had abandoned her and the child, and this she did, in Chicago, U.S.A.    The grandmother taught German to her grandson; by the time Louis von Koelnau was six years old, his grandmother had read to him in German: all of the Old Testament, all of the New Testament and all of Grimm's Fairy Tales. His parents had read to him by this time, in English, most of the world's great adventure stories.    Mr. von Koelnau received his primary and secondary schooling in the Minneapolis public schools. He then enrolled at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design (from which he was graduated with honors) and finally, the Royal Academy of Art in Stockholm, Sweden, for a two-year graduate program.    Next he sailed to many of the exotic ports of the world as a Merchant Marine seaman and then went to Florida to work as a designer and craftsman of fiberglass boats and other utilitarian objects. During this period he was extremely uncertain about his own capabilities as an artist, but when he came back to Minneapolis for a visit, friends convinced him to remain in Minneapolis and launch himself as a sculptor. Since that time, 25 years ago, Mr. von Koelnau has worked exclusively as a sculptor of clear resin objects. His style has evolved and unfolded over the years, and he feels he is doing right now, at age 73, the finest work he has ever done. He says if he had 2 or 3 lifetimes left, it would not be enough time to put into tangible form all the ideas he has.    His material is space-age and utterly modern, yet universal and timeless in its glorification of light, that ultimate mother of us all, that which, without which, there can be no life at all.    Louis von Koelnau's work is not intended to shock or confuse the viewer. Rater, he says he loves to make objects which are simply beautiful to look at and which invite the viewer to share his delight in the endless combination of light and shadow to be seen in his pieces.    The elegant, exuberant forms he gives us are exciting but no bizarre. They are timeless in their simplicity and invariably attractive to the innately tasteful collector who knows what is good and will wear well.    Resin sculpture.    Resin is a material, which is similar to lucite and plexiglass. A more familiar form of resin is amber, which is the fossilized resin of pine trees.    Although resin has been in use since the 1930s, we see it today in its more modern applications: in premium quality jewelry and in elegant collectibles often labeled “faux malachite” or “ivory”.    A resin sculpture is not easily shattered, but it can be scratched about as readily as varnished wood can. Such scratches can be repaired according to our instructions, which are provided upon request.    The strong, chunky forms Louis von Koelnau makes cold never be rendered in glass, because the thick parts of the piece would cool at different rates, exterior to interior, and the resultant stresses would cause breakage. Additionally, the weight would be unbearable and impractical.    Resin is not an easy material to work with. This undoubtedly, is the reason more sculptors do not work in resin.    The mold itself is difficult to make. Once the resin mixture, with its delicately balanced hardeners and pigments, has been poured into the mold, the process itself produces heat and then shrinkage within the mold, both of which can break the sculpture. Success with each pour is a question of exquisite chemistry and timing.    When the sculpture has been removed from the mold, it is very rough and only faintly recognizable as a work of art. After two or more days of curing at a slightly elevated temperature, the grinding and polishing begin. Using sand papers of increasingly finer grits, the surface is smoothed progressively. The buffing wheel produces the final shine. The artist then levels the piece, signs and numbers it and also incises the copyright (©) symbol.    Louis von Koelnau is a highly trained and thoroughly experienced artist, having been engaged exclusively in the making of resin sculpture for the past 25 years. He has never wavered from his long standing opinion of resin as the medium that offers limitless possibilities for artistic expression.    Louis von Koelnau's medium is light. He twists it and turns it. Pushes it through the narrows and brings it out to the broader areas of a work in a burst of energy.    Every von Koelnau sculpture is contoured from its earliest inception to achieve another life: to ultimately come alive and function as light or energy conductor.    When the artist begins his ruminations on a certain shape or subject, he makes fist-size sketches in wax, always devising to make the completed sculpture function primarily as a composition of lenses.    In a world grown tired of its own flash, von Koelnau returns our minds to the contemplation of light for its own sake. Light which enlivens and energizes. Light, which by Virtue of its commanding role in the universe never cases to fascinate us.    It is no surprise, then, to find von Koelnau's color range is mainly in pure, jewel-like colors of the spectrum: sapphire and icy blues, amethyst and mauve, soft to dark green, rich amber, and red and yellow as well.    von Koelnau's non-objective and abstract forms work not only as vehicles for light conduction, but also as pleasing organic shapes.    Since his boyhood, the bear studies have been recurring themes in von Koelnau's oeuvre. He says he is actually sculpting human beings: families, adults and children in the guise of bears. Why bears? He doesn't have an answer; he just keeps on conducting with his collectors an unspoken dialogue about warmth and intimacy and one's own private mythology. Forty-five years of constant demand for the bears seems to be proof enough of their lasting vitality.    Louis von Koelnau works solely in resin, a modern compound. It is not unlike amber, which is the fossilized resin of pine trees. Working as a boat builder and taxidermist for twenty years, the artist acquired extensive knowledge about the use and control of the resin medium.    Many artists have noticed the artistic potential in this medium, but almost invariably they find it impossible to work with. Such a situation virtually guarantees the uniqueness of von Koelnau's work.    Having spent 25 years acquiring the necessary technical expertise, von Koelnau is not about to give away any clues to budding artists. When they ask such questions as “How do you get it to come out of the mold without cracking?” he will reply, cryptically, “I hold my mouth just right while I'm pouring.”.	f_1331936.jpg

The duo finds inspiration from the desert and mid-Century modern architecture and design. The artwork follows the rules of simplicity and the color palettes used during the modernist period,as well as integration natural shapes and organic forms into the designs,but the techniques and color choices lend a coherence and life to the paintings which is often hard to find in vintage pieces.    Max Rodriguez/Patrick Max Artist Statements:    Fractured Night  As a child, I would become frightened at night when the darkness would set in and the city and structures would become dark. It didn't help that in Cuba, the government would shut off electricity for energy conservation without telling its people when it would return. I learned that the moon would light the clouds, the stars outlined the darkness below, and the candlelit windows would glow with calm.

Phillips cut and folded his materials to form overlaps and projections.

Circa 2013    A photographic perspective By it's very nature, photography enables us to engage the world through our individual vision. The discovery of worlds both large and small opens a myriad of paths for introspection and communication. For the viewer, images produced may seem representational, whimsical, or even evocative of powerful emotions. Photographs may record history, review our past, or exist to remind us of our humanity. As a contemporary photographer I regularly remind myself of photography's rules and norms, and yet I continuously ask myself " Why do these things matter?" Each image, whether communicating reality or some sense of the unknown, lives within the photographers mind as his personal visualization. Visualization is applied individually, and it is my intent to create photographs that transcend representation, bend reality, express feelings, or initiate conversation, through the creation of an image. -Don Saxton	f_1273638.jpg

A photographic perspective  By it's very nature, photography enables us to engage the world through our individual vision. The discovery of worlds both large and small opens a myriad of paths for introspection and communication. For the viewer, images produced may seem representational, whimsical, or even evocative of powerful emotions. Photographs may record history, review our past, or exist to remind us of our humanity. As a contemporary photographer I regularly remind myself of photography's rules and norms, and yet I continuously ask myself " Why do these things matter?"  Each image, whether communicating reality or some sense of the unknown, lives within the photographers mind as his personal visualization. Visualization is applied individually, and it is my intent to create photographs that transcend representation, bend reality, express feelings, or initiate conversation, through the creation of an image.                                                                             -Don Saxton	f_1113958.jpg

f_928770	2013-10-08 15:41:35	"Twin Palms" Oil on canvas by California Artist Danny Heller	Artist Statement  I paint the reality of the Southern California environment: how structures once  revered for their groundbreaking ideas in design and social planning have been  perpetuated and how they have been forgotten.    Primarily focusing on the area’s mid-century identity, I play with lighting, dramatic  angles, and specific colors to form engaging paintings that also capture architectural  elements.  I use a realistic style to paint those moments where design and  environment come together harmoniously in order to showcase the compelling  characteristics of these spaces.  In some ways, I act as a type of documentarian of  an endangered architectural culture in California.  However, these paintings are a bit  more personal, as they tend to focus on locations from my childhood or at least slices  of an era recounted to me from my parents’ and grandparents’ times.    By painting these historically and personally significant scenes, I hope to reconnect  with a presumably by-gone time period whose remnants actually still exist.  Because  especially in Los Angeles, where the past is demolished to make way for the brand  new, we are at risk of losing our cultural history.  Without which, we leave ourselves  devoid of a foundation to build our future on.    Danny Heller was born in Northridge, CA in 1982. Growing up in the San Fernando  Valley, the artist was able to carefully study the golden landscape of Los Angeles  which would shape his later body of work.  For formal art instruction, Danny left the  Valley for the College of Creative Studies at the University of California, Santa  Barbara.  While studying under landscape painter Hank Pitcher, Danny earned a B.  A. in art with an emphasis in painting.  After formative years spent capturing Santa  Barbara’s surf landscapes, Danny’s attention turned toward retro iconography  characteristic of mid-century Los Angeles.  Having set up his studio in Silver Lake,  the artist now concentrates on chronicling Modern American imagery, specifically  focusing on the architecture, design, and car culture found in Southern California.      Danny Heller's paintings have been exhibited in solo and group shows throughout  the world, from Paris to Los Angeles, and most recently in Nashville, TN. The variety  of collectors who have sought out his work are a testament to the artist’s success.  Some have purchased work featuring familiar locations, while others collect purely for  the artwork’s inherent formal qualities.	f_928770.jpg

There were only six of these produced sometime in the 70's. The Head and Feet are Dipped in 24 carat gold.    A porcelain “objet d’art” carrying the imprimatur “Mangani” comes with a dedication to excellence. The Mangani family oversees every facet of each porcelain object, from the initial plan of the design to the final decoration. The family involvement with porcelain began in the 1930’s. Sr. Mangani worked for one of Florence’s oldest ceramic works during the 1930’s. He conceived many porcelain sculptures for the wealthy English and Americans who lived in the sumptuous villas of Florence and its province of Tuscany. After World War II Mangani opened a small workshop for the restoration of marble, ceramic and porcelain. There his young sons Ivan and Lando were exposed to their father’s special skills, watching and working under his supervision. After many years of studying the fine art of porcelain, they took from their father both a knowledge of the technical aspects of the clay and an appreciation for the aesthetic of the material. The Mangani brothers brought this burgeoning expertise to their first small atelier in Florence, which they opened in the early 1960’s. With the application of modern techniques, they slowly developed and grew to become one of Florence’s foremost producers of fine porcelains. Ivan passed away in 2002 but left a great legacy to his children who are active participants with their cousins in the Mangani of today. Their production is quite diverse, ranging from reproductions of baroque period pieces to the highly stylized fish and birds with which their name is synonymous.	f_886049.jpg
f_880955	2013-08-19 19:19:02	"Offramp" Oil on linen by California Artist Barrie Mottishaw	Barrie Mottishaw, a dynamic painter of the changing California landscape.    Mottishaw, a veteran Los Angeles painter, and a visiting professor in Creative Studies at Pitzer, has been documenting Western landscape in flux since she returned from British Columbia, Canada, in the late 1970s. She has shown her work extensively in solo and group exhibitions since the early 1980s.    “Barrie Mottishaw and her paintings are intimately connected to the landscape: its history, texture, scale, colors, literature, and its future,” Michael Woodcock, Pitzer professor of Creative Studies, explains in his forward to the beautiful catalogue that accompanies the show. “She has trekked the urban, suburban and exurban, traveling across parking lots, through subdivisions, down the LA River channel and up the San Andreas Fault.”    “During thirty years of painting on site and in the studio, Mottishaw has evolved a poetic style which can be described as part 19th-century Romantic Sublime, part L.A. noir,” observes Koplin Del Rio Gallery on its Web site www.koplindelrio.com. “In this way the work evokes both the centuries old tradition of beauty in landscape painting as well as a more contemporary sense of urban malaise that comes from L.A.'s cinematic history.”    The trajectory of Mottishaw’s artistic working practice has been charted in a variety of magazine articles as well as exhibition reviews in such publications as the Los Angeles Times, USC’s California Artists Postcard Series and The California Artists Calendar 1990, ArtSphere (the magazine of the California International Art Foundation), San Diego Union Tribune, Artweek Magazine, the Los Angeles Daily News, L.A. Weekly, and the Claremont Courier. Reproductions of the artist's work have appeared in the magazines L.A. Architect, Connections, Wild Earth, and The Jewish Journal (London).    Her paintings can be seen in several university and museum collections, including the Orange County Museum of Art, University of California Santa Barbara Museum of Art, and the City of Santa Monica Art Bank. Mottishaw’s work has been acquired by private corporations and foundations such as Bank of America, Nestle Corporation, Peter and Eileen Norton Family Foundation, Deloitte and Touche LLP, Smith Barney, Payden and Rygel. It can also be found in the collections of private individuals throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe.	f_880955.jpg

Signed and numbered 6/10   The sculptor Victor Salmones was born in Mexico City in 1937 to parents of Spanish ancestry. His father came to Mexico from Spain in the early thirties. His mother was Spanish by heritage and Mexican by birth. His father died when Victor was young, so the boy began working part time to help support his family. In high school Victor found his talent and love for sculpture while modeling clay. He took as many classes in that school and later at the Universidad de las Americas as possible. This gave him a chance to find work in the commercial world of advertising in 1956. This made it possible for him to save money to the Instituto de Bellas Artes in 1962. There he met and was encouraged by the Bauhaus master Hoffman who offered him an apprenticeship. This led Victor to open his own sculpture workshop in Cuernavaca in 1966. A year later he won a first prize for his sculpture of "Adam" at the Biennale Exposition of the National Museum of Modern Art. Other prizes followed as he continued to produce bronzes and place them in public and private collections around the world. His untimely death in 1989 cut short his career.

f_821781	2013-06-10 18:01:50	An Original Painting By American Artist Agnes Sims (1910 - 1990)	A mixed media on board from the 1960's by American  Artist Agnes Sims   "Agi" Sims is known for paintings and sculptures inspired by prehistoric rock art of New Mexico.    Born in Devon, Pennsylvania, Sims attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art and the Philadelphia School of Design for Women.  She managed a traveling marionette theater before establishing herself as a textile and needlework designer in Philadelphia.    After a visit to New Mexico in 1938, Sims returned to Philadelphia, packed her belongings, and returned to make Santa Fe her permanent home.  She opened a classical record store in an eighteenth-century farmhouse on Canyon Road, but the shortage of shellac during the War put her out of business.  Sims then became a building contractor (skills taught her by her contractor father), purchasing and renovating historic houses around Santa Fe.  She later bought a nineteenth-century house with acreage on Canyon Road and built a compound including a house for herself and one for her long-time partner, Mary Louise Aswell, the fiction editor at Harper's Bazaar who had brought writers such as Eurdora Welty and Truman Capote to the public's attention.    Shortly after her arrival, a friend introduced Sims to the Galisteo Basin south of Santa Fe which was dotted with the ruins of prehistoric Indian Pueblos, and home to tens of thousands of ancient petroglyphs.  The rock art captivated Sims and became her primary inspiration for the rest of her career.  Over the next decade she recorded 3000 petroglyphs in drawings and thousands more in photographs.  In 1949 she received a grant from the American Philosophical Society to further her research, and in 1950 she published a portfolio of selected rock at drawings in her monograph, San Cristobal Petroglyphs.    Most of Sims paintings and sculptures were inspired by petroglyphs, but unlike her documentary drawings they never were literal copies.  Rather she adopted and adapted the two-dimensional representations of people and animal into an art that fit comfortably into the larger world of mid-century modernism.  She used simple, idiosyncratic figures to create her own symbolism, the original meanings of the ancient art being mostly lost to the past.    Sims worked in a wide array of media.  Her oil paintings on canvas often were mixed with an earthen medium which gave them a rough, stone-like texture.  She developed a batik-like resist process for painting on cloth, and used it to produce large, un-stretched wall hangings.  She used this technique to produce an architectural frieze 3.5 feet high and almost 150 feet long which still adorns the Century Bank lobby in downtown Santa Fe.  Sims was a prolific sculptor, working in wood, stone, bronze, terracotta, fiberglass, and polyester.    Sims was given one-woman shows at the Brooklyn Museum, U.S. Embassy in London, Folger Library, Colorado Springs Fine Art Center, Santa Barbara Museum of Art, McNay Art Institute in San Antonio, Texas, and the Museum of Fine Art in Santa Fe.  She also showed her work at the gallery she owned on Canyon Road.  At times, she rented studio space in her gallery building to local artisans, hoping to spark a revival of early New Mexico arts and crafts.    Although she did not offer formal instruction, Sims was known for her generous encouragement of younger artists.  In the large patio of the Canyon Road compound, she hosted public performances of original dance, music, and theater and readings by local authors.  She also was known for her love of good food and scotch and living strictly on her own terms.  She was honored with the New Mexico Governor's Award for Excellence and Achievements in the Arts a few months before her death from Alzheimer's disease in 1990.  	f_821781.jpg
f_821754	2013-06-10 18:45:08	Monterey Cypress in Bronze by California Artist Daniel  Garcia 1929 -2012	A Signed Monterey Cypress Tree in Bronze by California Artist Daniel (Danny) Garcia  April 23, 1929 ~ May 12, 2012  Danny Garcia was born in a white, two-story house on a hill overlooking the Pacific coastal community of Monterey, California, on April 23, 1929.  Of Portuguese ancestry, the artist acquired as a child the age-old knowledge and understanding of the Sea that his parents brought with them from the Azores.  His work reflects his recourse to it as a source of life and inspiration.    As a high school student, he worked as laboratory assistant and skin diver for local marine biologist Ed Ricketts on whom John Steinbeck based his character "Doc" in his novel, Cannery Row.  This experience is reflected in his use of the "vertical color flow" that he originated to portray the columns and rays of refracted light in his undersea paintings.  Two years of naval service in the Far East left an Oriental imprint on his renderings of landscapes and urban scenes.  He studied art and architecture at Monterey Peninsula College, but his creativity and keen perception have lead him away from traditional styles to develop his own particular modes of expression in the several media in which he creates his work.  Primarily an impressionist, Garcia's work ranges in style from realism to abstraction; he is a brilliant colorist and a creative force behind the "Carmel School of Art".     Monsignor Edward Varni commissioned Garcia to paint the fourteen "Stations of the Cross" for the Chapel of the Most Precious Blood in Concord, and Father Jeremiah O'Sullivan commissioned Garcia to paint "The Crucifixion" for the alter of Saint Jude's Church in Marina, California.  His paintings are in the permanent collections of the Kaiser Center Art Gallery in Oakland, California, the Museum Museum of Art in Monroe, Louisiana, and the Museum of Natural History and Art in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Notable private collectors who have acquired his work include Princess Margaret, Greer Garson, Mrs. Robert F, Kennedy, Mr. and Mrs. Steve Allen, Trini Lopez, Dean Martin, Mrs. Lauritz Melchior, Mr. and Mrs. George Shearing, Frank Sinatra, Bill Walsh, David Packard and David Duvall.     Garcia's use of impasto for textural effect in his paintings reveals a propensity and talent for sculpture, which have come to rival those for his painting in the last twenty years.  The particular inspiration for his sculptural talent has been the Monterey Cypress Tree, unique to his beloved Monterey Peninsula.  His equally unique miniature rendering of the Monterey Cypress in bronze emulates the art of bonsai and features the use of native Monterey Jade in pieces that range in size from six-inch freestanding sculptures to wall-hangers designed to custom specifications.  His range of sculptural subjects has extended to the representation of sailboats, cattails and even to scenes taken from Monterey's Fisherman's Wharf and Cannery Row.         Though he has devoted much time and energy to his sculpture during this period, painting remains Garcia's first-love and primary passion.  Recent years have seen a renewal of his commitment to it as he has completed numerous works to be displayed in his gallery as well as those commissioned by commercial patrons, such as Semco Engineering.  The Diocese of Danville, California, commissioned a full-sized portrait of "Saint Isidore, Patron Saint of the Farmer", to be displayed at the entrance of the new Community Room of Saint Isidore's Church.	f_821754.jpg

This instilled in him an alternative way of looking at the world.  Armed with his mother’s Nikon Camera at age 9 it was apparent that he saw beauty in objects, which eluded others.    By age ten, he had written Picasso to offer his appreciation on his work and to show him some of his own.    “I have always believed that art should be an immense pleasure. To experiment with ways of seeing and representing sight. It was this quest and the enormous advances in computer science, which brought me out of the darkroom and opened the door to blending the photograph, the paintbrush, colors and rays of light into what I call: Illustrated Lomography”    David’s ambitious experiment has certainly paid off. His work can be found in a number of private collections.	f_712560.jpg

In 1950 she entered the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, studying there until leaving for Paris in 1952 where she moved into the Academie Frochot.
