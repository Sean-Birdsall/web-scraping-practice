{"name":"\"Parrot\" Sculpture Made by Oggetti of Italy and Designed by Mangani","period":"circa 1970s","description":"\"Parrot\" made by Oggetti and designed by Mangani. This rare bird was produced sometime in the 1970s. The feet are dipped in 24-carat gold. A porcelain “objet d’art” carrying the imprimatur “Mangani” comes with a dedication to excellence. The Mangani family oversees every facet of each porcelain object, from the initial plan of the design to the final decoration. The family involvement with porcelain began in the 1930s. Sr. Mangani worked for one of Florence’s oldest ceramic works during the 1930s. He conceived many porcelain sculptures for the wealthy English and Americans who lived in the sumptuous villas of Florence and its province of Tuscany. After World War II Mangani opened a small workshop for the restoration of marble, ceramic and porcelain. There his young sons Ivan and Lando were exposed to their father’s special skills, watching and working under his supervision. After many years of studying the fine art of porcelain, they took from their father both a knowledge of the technical aspects of the clay and an appreciation for the aesthetic of the material. The Mangani brothers brought this burgeoning expertise to their first small atelier in Florence, which they opened in the early 1960s. With the application of modern techniques, they slowly developed and grew to become one of Florence’s foremost producers of fine porcelains. Ivan passed away in 2002 but left a great legacy to his children who are active participants with their cousins in the Mangani of today. Their production is quite diverse, ranging from reproductions of Baroque period pieces to the highly stylized fish and birds with which their name is synonymous.","price":"$1,800","condition":"Excellent","measurements":{"width":"13.5","height":"23","depth":"15"},"numOfItems":"1","imageUrl":"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/alamod-inventory/f_1870592.jpg"},
